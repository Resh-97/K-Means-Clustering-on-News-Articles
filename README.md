#  K-Means Clustering on News Articles
 Perform K-Means clustering on news articles of mixed topics including business, entertainment, politics, sports and technology. This was done as part of my Post Graduate Program in AI & ML.

### Dataset:
-  **“NewsArticles.json”** is present at '/datasets/NewsArticles.json'

### Tasks Performed:
   1. Perform K-Means clustering on the dataset and find the value of Sum of Squared Error (SSE) 
   2. Use PCA algorithm to reduce the dimension of the dataset and then perform K-means clustering on the manipulated dataset and find the value of Sum of Squared Error (SSE) 
   3. Find the cluster having the highest value of count (before PCA)
   4. Find the cluster having the highest value of count (after PCA). 
   5. Extract top 50 words from each cluster in both the cases and print the last word (50th word) from the cluster of news articles related to the entertainment (before PCA) 
   6. Extract top 50 words from each cluster in both the cases and print the last word (50th word) from the third cluster (after PCA)
